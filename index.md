## about me
Hi ! i'm [pusti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pusti-jesrani-5099b7241/), a junior studying computer science and data science at uw madison.

I enjoy diving deep into low-level programming and systems design, understanding how things work at their core, and optimizing for performance. I’m passionate about working on creative projects, from coding interactive applications to designing sleek user interfaces. 

I'm excited to be a new coo-rd at the [Undergraduate Project Lab](https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu) this spring, and the VP at [sheepshead club](https://uwmadisonsheepshead.notion.site/UW-Madison-Sheepshead-Homepage-67ff4fe0ce934d428f2e63c8ef0c6220)! I also love art, cooking and visually aesthetic games.

feel free to reach out to me on my socials !
